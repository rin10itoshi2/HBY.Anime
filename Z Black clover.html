            Asther and Juno were abandoned in a church at birth and grew together inseparably. As children, they made a pact with each other to compete for the title of Emperor of Witches. However, when they grew up, the difference between them became apparent. Yuno was a genius in witchcraft with great power and mastery, while Astaire could not use magic at all. But he tried to make up for his lack with physical training. When they got their makeup at the age of 15, Yuno received an amazing book with four-leaf clover (most people get three-leaf clover), while Esther got nothing. However, when Yuno was in danger, the truth about Aster's power was revealed; he was given a five-pointed clover-clovered grimoire, a "black clover"! Now two friends are entering the world, both with the same goal!
